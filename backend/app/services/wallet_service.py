    """Locks the user row so concurrent balance-mutating requests serialize.

    Requires an active DB transaction (started implicitly by AsyncSession);
    the lock is released on commit/rollback. `populate_existing=True` is
    required here: `get_current_user` already loaded this same User earlier
    in the request, so without it SQLAlchemy's identity map would silently
    return that stale (pre-lock) object instead of the freshly locked row —
    the FOR UPDATE lock would still serialize correctly at the SQL level,
    but every caller's check-then-write would read outdated values, making
    the lock pointless.

    `with_for_update(of=User)` scopes the row lock to just the `users` table:
    `User.active_badge` is `lazy="joined"` (a LEFT OUTER JOIN to badges), and
    a plain `FOR UPDATE` tries to lock every joined table including the
    nullable side of that outer join, which Postgres rejects outright
    (`FeatureNotSupportedError`). Restricting the lock to `users` keeps the
    eager-loaded badge while avoiding that restriction.
