    batch comes back short of BATCH_SIZE — a full batch means there's
    likely more backlog (e.g. a bulk admin broadcast to thousands of
    users), so the next fetch runs immediately. A purely sequential,
    one-at-a-time dispatcher took tens of minutes to drain a ~9000-row
    broadcast; this drains the same backlog in a few minutes while
    actually respecting Telegram's rate limit throughout.
